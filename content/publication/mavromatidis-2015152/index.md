abstract: Buildings are expected to significantly contribute to the adoption of renewables,
  and mainly solar technologies due to largely unutilised roof space. A framework
  to assist the decision making process towards the optimal integration of solar energy
  in urban areas, with the focus on photovoltaic panels, considering spatiotemporal
  aspects, is presented using a village in Switzerland as a case study. Calculating
  the solar potential of the examined area is the first step towards determining the
  optimal structures to install photovoltaics. Utilisation of weather station measurements
  for the solar resource of a built-up area is prone to errors due to the complicated
  geometry of the built environment. Therefore, modelling in order to accurately determine
  the solar potential on a spatiotemporal scale is presented as the most promising
  solution. A workflow utilising Digital Elevation Models (DEM) is presented in order
  to create solar availability profiles for each building examined, taking into account
  the different surface orientations, the neighbouring structures, but also the surrounding
  topography. With the same techniques, the area availability for such installations
  is also quantified. In the next step, synthetic profiles for the electricity demand
  of the buildings are created taking into account the different building types. Having
  modelled the solar resource as well as the demand for electricity in the building
  stock of the examined area, the energy hub concept is employed to optimise the management
  of the renewable energy flows, considering multiple objectives. The energy hub output
  allows us to determine the optimal roof surfaces for solar installations that minimise
  the cost of meeting the energy demand and/or maximise the amount of solar electricity
  that can be used locally. Due to the intermittency of solar radiation and the temporal
  mismatch of solar availability and electricity demand, energy storage is also included
  in the energy system and its capacity is optimised to increase utilisation of solar
  electricity.
