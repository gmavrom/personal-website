abstract: Energy models are valuable tools that are commonly employed for the optimal
  design of distributed energy systems (DES). However, the model-based design process
  of DES can be affected by uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal design decisions
  and is introduced by aspects like the stochastic nature of renewables or the unknown
  future global energy and economy outlook. A critical first step of any effort to
  examine and incorporate uncertainty in the design process of DES includes the performance
  of a thorough uncertainty characterisation (UC). The UC task comprises the identification
  of the sources of uncertainty in the model's parameters and the assignment of a
  mathematical description to their uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to identify
  and categorise the most important uncertain parameters in typical DES design models
  and review the approaches used in the literature to represent their uncertainty.
  The uncertain aspects investigated pertain to the availability of renewable energy
  (wind and solar), the economic and environmental dimensions of energy carriers in
  a DES, the costs and technical characteristics of the technologies composing a DES,
  and, finally, the uncertain energy demands that a DES must satisfy. The analysis
  reveals the diversity and the varying complexity levels of the approaches used to
  characterise each parameter's uncertainty, as well as the specific parameters on
  which studies in the literature have mostly focused. Additionally, this review can
  serve to assist modellers who wish to introduce uncertainty considerations in their
  DES design model with the selection of appropriate UC approaches. Finally, in discussing
  the results of this review, directions for more effective UC in DES design are discussed,
  as well as suggestions for the integration of uncertainty in the design process
  of DES.
