abstract: This paper aims to integrate decentralized energy systems in a village in
  Switzerland, which has the goal to phase out fossil fuels and rely on local renewable
  energy sources. To reach this ambitious target, a revision of the current energy
  system is required together with retrofitting of the building stock. The method
  applied is based on the energy hub concept, which can be used to optimize the energy
  consumption during planning and operation. To apply the energy hub concept at neighbourhood
  level, a three step approach is required, including modelling the energy demand
  of the buildings, the evaluation of the local renewable potential, and the management
  and optimization of demand and supply. Centralized and decentralized local renewable
  sources are investigated, namely photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power. Scenarios
  are evaluated based on their environmental performance and savings of CO2 emissions.
  Results show that an energy sustainability (ratio of energy demand covered by renewables)
  of 83% and a CO2 emissions reduction of 86% can be achieved. The results further
  suggest that up to 50% of the available energy potential from renewables cannot
  be utilized in this community when insufficient storage is provided in the energy
  system.
