abstract: The effective design of Distributed Energy Systems (DES) is subject to multiple
  uncertainties related to aspects like the availability of renewable energy, the
  building energy demands, and the energy carrier prices. Nevertheless, current practices
  involve the use of deterministic design models, which overlook uncertainty and can
  lead to suboptimal DES configurations that fail to deliver the desired performance.
  A necessary condition in order to obtain robust DES designs against uncertainty
  is the understanding of uncertaintyâ€™s impacts and main drivers. Therefore, this
  paper presents a novel methodological framework for the investigation of uncertainty
  in the context of DES design, which combines optimisation-based DES models and techniques
  from Uncertainty Analysis (UA) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Moreover,
  the application of the framework is illustrated with a case study for the optimal
  DES design of a Swiss urban neighbourhood. Embarking from a deterministic DES design
  model, first, all sources of uncertainty are identified and appropriate probabilistic
  descriptions are assigned to all uncertain model parameters. UA is then performed
  using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to quantify the impacts of uncertainty. Results
  reveal substantial variations in terms of economic and carbon performance of the
  optimal DES, but also in terms of optimal DES configurations. Moreover, the UA results
  indicate that the optimal system costs are mostly higher than the deterministic
  cost estimates, while the inverse is observed for the case of carbon emissions.
  Additionally, in many of the MC simulations, the resulting optimal DES configurations
  deviate significantly from the deterministically obtained designs, which confirms
  the risk of suboptimal decisions in deterministic design processes. Moreover, the
  results of UA can function as decision support by identifying the DES configurations
  that are optimal for most realisations of uncertainty. Finally, to identify the
  uncertain parameters that are mostly responsible for the variation of the economic
  performance of the DES, a two-step GSA is launched, combining the Morris method
  and the variance-based Sobol method. Results of the GSA indicate the energy demand
  patterns and the energy carrier prices as primarily responsible for the variability
  of the optimal system cost, while parameters like the investment costs and the technical
  characteristics of the technologies exert only minimal influence. The results of
  GSA, besides offering a better understanding of uncertainty to DES designers, also
  identify the parameters for which additional effort needs to be invested to reduce
  their uncertainty and, as a result, the uncertainty associated with DES design.
