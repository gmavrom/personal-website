abstract: This study presents MANGO (Multi-stAge eNerGy Optimization), a novel optimization
  model that incorporates a multi-year planning horizon, along with flexible, multi-stage
  investment strategies for the effective, long-term design of decentralized multi-energy
  systems (D-MES). By considering the dynamic surrounding energy and techno-economic
  landscape that evolves over time, MANGO harnesses the strategic value of investment
  flexibility and can optimally phase D-MES investments in order to benefit, for instance,
  from projected future reduced technology costs and technical improvements. To achieve
  this, the model considers the most relevant dynamic aspects, such as year-to-year
  variations in energy demands, changing energy carrier and technology prices, technical
  improvements and equipment degradation. MANGO is also capable of optimizing the
  design of complex configurations composed of multiple, interconnected D-MES installed
  at different locations. Finally, the model’s formulation also addresses end-of-horizon
  effects that can distort solutions in multi-stage energy system models. Besides
  presenting the key aspects and the mathematical formulation of MANGO, this study
  also uses the model to develop a six-stage energy design plan, along a 30-year project
  horizon, for an urban district composed of 3 sites in Zurich, Switzerland. One candidate
  D-MES is considered per site and different scenarios are examined regarding building
  retrofitting and D-MES interconnections. Results overall show that retrofitting
  leads to lower emission levels, but significantly higher costs. On the other hand,
  D-MES interconnections improve both the economic and the environmental system performance.
  Finally, regarding optimal D-MES configurations, a variety of technologies is used,
  with combinations of air-source heat pumps and natural gas boilers leading to better
  economic performance and combinations of ground-source heat pumps and biomass boilers
  to more environmentally-friendly designs. Overall, MANGO facilitates D-MES decision-making
  at the strategic level by delivering flexible multi-stage investment strategies,
  at the economic level by providing detailed information about the systems’ economic
  performance during each project year and, finally, at the technical level by specifying
  the optimal technical configurations of each D-MES and their optimal operating schedules.
  With its long-term perspective, MANGO can offer insights that closely match the
  dynamic class of real-world energy system design projects led by energy developers.
