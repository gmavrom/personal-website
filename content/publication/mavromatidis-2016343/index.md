abstract: Within the general context of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction,
  decomposition analysis allows the quantification of the contribution of different
  factors to changes in emissions as well as the assessment of the effectiveness of
  policy and technology measures. The Kaya identity has been widely used for that
  purpose in order to disaggregate carbon emissions into various driving forces. In
  this paper, it is applied for the analysis of emissions resulting from energy use
  at three different scales. First, a decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions
  for the complete Swiss energy system is presented using the future projections from
  the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050. The Kaya identity is then applied to the Swiss building
  sector after it is adapted with factors that are more relatable to building parameters,
  such as floor area instead of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Finally, the last level
  of analysis is a small scale community energy system for a unique Swiss village
  that aims to significantly reduce its emissions. An energy strategy is developed
  and its effectiveness is assessed with the adapted Kaya identity and benchmarked
  against the Swiss average values. The presented method demonstrates how the performance
  of buildings under various retrofitting scenarios can be benchmarked against future
  emission targets.
