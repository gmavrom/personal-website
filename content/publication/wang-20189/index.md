abstract: 'This paper presents the building stock model CESAR (Combined Energy Simulation
  And Retrofitting), which is based on bottom-up modelling methodology for the development
  of sustainable energy transformation strategies for the buildings in Swiss districts.
  CESAR is composed of two sub-models: a Demand Model (DM) and a Retrofitting Model
  (RM). The DM is tasked with identifying the current energy demand of buildings in
  districts. It builds on geo-referenced information and available census data, and
  its flexibility allows it to be applicable to any kind of residential neighbourhood
  within Switzerland. The DM is based on an automated bottom-up modelling technique,
  which employs the dynamic building energy simulation software tool EnergyPlus as
  its simulation core to generate hourly energy demand profiles of individual buildings
  taking the interactions with neighbouring buildings (e.g. shading and solar inter-reflections)
  into account. Once current energy demands are calculated by the DM, the RM further
  offers the possibility to apply a set of energy transformation scenarios, based
  on the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050, to generate future demand and emission projections
  of districts including key economic indicators. Besides that, the building energy
  performance under climate change projections can be evaluated. In this paper, the
  tool is applied on three case study districts, an urban, suburban and rural area,
  within Switzerland and different transformation scenarios according to the Energy
  Strategy are investigated. Results revealed significant differences between the
  two implemented transformation scenarios, the Business as Usual (WWB) and the New
  Energy Policy (NEP). While in the WWB scenario, only a small number of buildings
  reaches the intended targets for primary energy and GHG emissions until 2050, the
  NEP scenario induces a much higher transformation of the districts. Besides that,
  the significance of the impact of global warming on future cooling demand is shown.'
