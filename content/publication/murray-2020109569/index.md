abstract: Technical energy regulations are an important measure to reach climate targets.
  However, with recent developments in new technologies (such as decentralized energy
  systems, urban energy systems, energy storage systems, etc.) many different options
  and combination of measures exist to decarbonize the building stock, which requires
  an update of current versions of technical energy regulations. The aim of this work
  is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts
  to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support
  policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future.
  A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define
  representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate
  the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions.
  Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission
  targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together
  with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to
  be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district
  level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level
  solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas.
