abstract: 'We present a comprehensive review of modelling approaches and associated
  software tools that address district-level energy systems. Buildings play an important
  role in urban energy systems regarding both the demand and supply of energy. It
  is no longer sufficient to simulate building energy use assuming isolation from
  the microclimate and energy system in which they operate, or to model an urban energy
  system without consideration of the buildings that it serves. This review complements
  previous studies by focussing on models that address district-level interactions
  in energy systems, and by assessing the capabilities of the software tools available
  alongside the theory of the modelling approaches used. New models and tools that
  address these district-level interactions are reviewed and their competences assessed.
  These are divided into the following sections: district energy systems (including
  heat networks, multi-energy systems and low-temperature networks), renewable energy
  generation (including solar, bioenergy, wind and the related topic of seasonal storage),
  and the urban microclimate as it relates to energy demands. The scope and detail
  covered by twenty cross-disciplinary tools is summarised in a matrix; many other
  tools that focus on specific areas are also discussed. We end by summarising the
  current state of district-scale urban energy modelling as it relates to the built
  environment, along with our perspective on future challenges and research directions.'
