abstract: Uncertainty introduces significant complexity to the design process of distributed
  energy systems (DES) and introduces the risk of suboptimal decisions when the design
  is performed deterministically. Therefore, it is important that computational DES
  design models are able to account for the most relevant uncertainty sources when
  identifying optimal DES configurations. In this paper, a model for optimal DES design
  under uncertainty is presented and is formulated as a Two-stage Stochastic Mixed-Integer
  Linear Program. As uncertain parameters, energy carrier prices and emission factors,
  building heating and electricity demands, and incoming solar radiation patterns
  are considered and probabilistic scenarios are used to describe their uncertainty.
  The model seeks to make cost-optimal DES design decisions (technology selection
  and sizing) before these uncertain parameters are known, while it also identifies
  the optimal operation of the selected DES configuration for multiple uncertain scenarios.
  Moreover, two strategies for emission reduction are employed that set CO2 limits
  either to the system’s average emissions under uncertainty (‘neutral’ strategy)
  or individually to the system’s emissions for every possible uncertainty outcome
  to ensure a more robust emission performance (‘aggressive’ strategy). To illustrate
  the model’s application, the design of a DES for a Swiss urban neighbourhood of
  10 buildings is investigated. Multiple optimal DES configurations are obtained by
  using the ‘neutral’ and ‘aggressive’ emission reduction strategies and the trade-offs
  between the systems’ economic and emission performance are analysed. Moreover, the
  optimal DES are contrasted in terms of technology selection and energy consumption
  shares among fossil fuels, grid electricity and renewable energy. Finally, all model
  outputs are compared to results obtained from a deterministic design model. The
  comparison showed that the deterministic model leads to underestimations of the
  system costs and inaccurate estimates of the system’s CO2 emissions. Moreover, the
  deterministic designs, in many cases, underestimate the renewable energy capacity
  that is required to meet the imposed CO2 limits. These significant differences between
  the stochastic and the deterministic model results can serve to confirm the shortfalls
  of deterministic design.
