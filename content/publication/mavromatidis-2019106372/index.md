abstract: Distributed Multi-Energy Systems (D-MES) can sustainably transform the energy
  supply of buildings, districts, and communities by integrating multiple energy efficient
  technologies, renewable energy sources, and electricity, gas, and thermal energy
  networks to provide heating, cooling and electricity services. However, D-MES typically
  exhibit high levels of technical complexity and encompass various economic, environmental,
  and policy-related aspects. Consequently, energy models are needed to optimally
  design and operate D-MES and to analyze their performance in detail. A multitude
  of aspects must be considered when developing a D-MES model. A first aspect, for
  instance, is whether an optimization or a simulation approach is more appropriate
  for the model's scope. Moreover, it is important to accurately represent all the
  relevant technical characteristics and performance constraints of the various energy
  generation, storage and distribution network technologies in the model. Additionally,
  in many cases, adopting approaches from other domains like urban and building energy
  simulation might be required to identify building requirements for heating, cooling,
  and electricity. Additional aspects, such as the uncertainty of a model's parameters,
  which complicates D-MES design and operation decisions, or the computational burdens
  imposed by extending these models towards the whole-city scale also need to be considered.
  Finally, methods that can bridge models that focus on specific sub-dimensions of
  D-MES and allow for more holistic D-MES modeling need to be developed. This paper
  aims to address these key challenges and to outline recent developments in the field
  of modeling of D-MES by answering ten questions about the most relevant D-MES modeling
  dimensions.
