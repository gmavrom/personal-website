abstract: In this paper, a method for a multi-objective and simultaneous optimisation
  of building energy systems and retrofit is presented. Tailored to be suitable for
  the diverse range of existing buildings in terms of age, size, and use, it combines
  dynamic energy demand simulation to explore individual retrofit scenarios with an
  energy hub optimisation. Implemented as an epsilon-constrained mixed integer linear
  program (MILP), the optimisation matches envelope retrofit with renewable and high
  efficiency energy supply technologies such as biomass boilers, heat pumps, photovoltaic
  and solar thermal panels to minimise life cycle cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  Due to its multi-objective, integrated assessment of building transformation options
  and its ability to capture both individual building characteristics and trends within
  a neighbourhood, this method is aimed to provide developers, neighbourhood and town
  policy makers with the necessary information to make adequate decisions. Our method
  is deployed in a case study of typical residential buildings in the Swiss village
  of Zernez, simulating energy demands in EnergyPlus and solving the optimisation
  problem with CPLEX. Although common trade-offs in energy system and retrofit choice
  can be observed, optimisation results suggest that the diversity in building age
  and size leads to optimal strategies for retrofitting and building system solutions,
  which are specific to different categories. With this method, GHG emissions of the
  entire community can be reduced by up to 76% at a cost increase of 3% compared to
  the current emission levels, if an optimised solution is selected for each building
  category.
