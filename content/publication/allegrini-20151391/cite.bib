 abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of modelling approaches and associated software tools that address district-level energy systems. Buildings play an important role in urban energy systems regarding both the demand and supply of energy. It is no longer sufficient to simulate building energy use assuming isolation from the microclimate and energy system in which they operate, or to model an urban energy system without consideration of the buildings that it serves. This review complements previous studies by focussing on models that address district-level interactions in energy systems, and by assessing the capabilities of the software tools available alongside the theory of the modelling approaches used. New models and tools that address these district-level interactions are reviewed and their competences assessed. These are divided into the following sections: district energy systems (including heat networks, multi-energy systems and low-temperature networks), renewable energy generation (including solar, bioenergy, wind and the related topic of seasonal storage), and the urban microclimate as it relates to energy demands. The scope and detail covered by twenty cross-disciplinary tools is summarised in a matrix; many other tools that focus on specific areas are also discussed. We end by summarising the current state of district-scale urban energy modelling as it relates to the built environment, along with our perspective on future challenges and research directions.},
