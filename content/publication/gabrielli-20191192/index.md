abstract: This work proposes a framework for the robust design of multi-energy systems
  when limited information on the input data is available. The optimal design of a
  decentralized system involving renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies
  is considered by formulating a mixed integer linear program that determines the
  optimal selection, size, and operation of the system to provide energy to an end
  user, while minimizing its total annual costs and CO2 emissions. Different aspects
  related to the feasibility and the optimality resulting when operating the multi-energy
  system on input data different than those used for the design are studied. Input
  data include weather conditions, energy demands and energy prices. First, considering
  a single input scenario, we define the resolution required to describe the time
  profiles of the input data. To do so, we aggregate hourly-resolved yearly time-series
  through a different number of typical design days, and we define the minimum number
  of typical design days necessary to obtain feasible and optimal system designs when
  these are operated on the original input profiles. Next, the uncertainty of weather
  conditions and energy demands is analyzed. This is described through several scenarios,
  which are created by combining different climate models, greenhouse gas emissions
  forecasts and models of buildings. The system configurations obtained with one of
  these scenarios are evaluated by introducing performance indicators that quantify
  the robustness and the cost optimality attained when operating the selected design
  on all other possible scenarios. Furthermore, correlations between performance indicators,
  structure and size of the system, and relevant characteristics of the input scenarios
  are identified. Based on this analysis, a robust scenario is defined, which requires
  information on the average scenario only, and its performance is compared against
  those of the average and of the worst-case scenarios when used to design a multi-energy
  system. Several designs are investigated, focusing on the minimization of costs
  and CO2 emissions, showing that the proposed robust scenario allows obtaining a
  robust and optimal system design through a deterministic optimization problem, hence
  maintaining the computation complexity at a minimum. Despite the higher robustness
  and cost optimality, slightly higher CO2 emissions are observed than the average
  and the worst-case scenarios. The proposed method is illustrated by performing the
  optimal design of a multi-energy system providing electricity and heat to a Swiss
  urban neighborhood, typical of the city of Zurich.
