abstract: ' ABSTRACTComputational optimization is gaining popularity in energy-efficient
  building design. For choosing an algorithm or setting its parameters, often mathematical
  test functions are employed. This study, therefore, investigates differences and
  similarities between such test functions and building energy optimization (BEO)
  problems. A fitness landscape analysis (FLA) is conducted with existing and newly
  proposed metrics, shedding light on the characteristics of optimization problems.
  We use the COCO testbed and compare it to BEO problems from the literature. Results
  suggest that for most FLA metrics there is no statistical difference between the
  set of test functions and BEO problems. Also, characterizing an archetypical BEO
  problem appears infeasible due to the high heterogeneity we can observe in FLA metric
  scores. However, using hierarchical clustering we can identify similarities between
  test functions and groups of BEO problems. Such knowledge may be exploited for selecting
  or calibrating an algorithm, thus facilitating its effective use in practice.'
